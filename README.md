I have created a machine learning model that recognizes handwritten digits. 
This model likely uses image processing techniques combined with deep learning algorithms, such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs), to analyze and classify digit images accurately. 
 It can be utilized in various applications like digitized form processing, automated data entry, and educational tools for handwriting analysis.
